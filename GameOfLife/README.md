GameOfLife
==========

This was a side-project I worked on during my semester taking CS1122, and is a Java GUI implementation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). Includes a runnable .jar file which plays the game.

Included is a screen-shot of the game in action:
